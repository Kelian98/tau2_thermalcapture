## Quick start

Initiate classes by hand :

```python
# Import and create object from this class to adjust parameters of the camera
from tau2_class import *
Tau2 = FLIR_Tau2()
========== CMD : Connected to the FLIR Tau2 camera ==========
gain_mode, _ = Tau2.get_gain_mode()
gain_mode
>>> GAIN MODE : 0X0002 = High Gain Only
Tau2.__exit__() # need to exit before starting acquisition for protocol purposes
========== CMD : Disconnecting from camera ==========

#Â Import and create object from this class to start image acquisition
from tau2_grab import *
camera = TeaxGrabber()
========== ACQ : Connected to the FLIR Tau2 camera ==========
imlist = camera.grab_image(duration=1.0, display=True)
camera.__exit__() # need to exit before starting acquisition for protocol purposes
========== ACQ : Disconnecting from camera ==========
```

Customize and run *acquisition.py* script :
```python
run acquisition.py

## Basic usage

- *tau2_class.py* contains `FLIR_Tau2` class, which allows to communicate with the camera through **serial** protocol and adjust settings (i.e. gain mode, FFC mode...)
- *tau2_grab.py* contains `TeaxGrabber` class, which allows to get RAW images from the camera and save them to **FITS** format through the **FTDI** protocol.
- *tau2_instructions.py* contains all instructions to send to the camera and *default_settings* dictionary which applies default parameters after camera initialization in **serial** mode.
- *acquisition.py* is a quick script which runs continuous acquisition of images.
